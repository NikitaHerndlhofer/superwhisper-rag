# SQL cookbook

The full reference of query patterns. The bundled `SKILL.md` (`src/skill.md`)
carries a condensed instruction-only variant of these recipes for the agent;
this document is the extended reference for humans, with the full commentary
and the stats recipes that the skill trims out. The recipe block below is
delimited by the `swrag:cookbook` HTML comments.

> **Defaults.**
>
> - `swrag sql` opens the archive **read-only**. Writes fail.
> - Output is **sqlite3's default list mode** (pipe-separated, no header).
>   For JSON, CSV, or any other mode, see "Other output modes" below.
> - There is **no `embed(:q)`** or `--param`. For semantic search,
>   compose with the shell: `$(echo 'your text' | swrag embed)` expands to a
>   `x'…'` blob literal before SQL is parsed. For text containing quotes,
>   `$`, or backticks, use the **stdin** form (see "Quoting-safe semantic
>   search" below) — a quoted heredoc disables shell expansion entirely.
> - **Always filter `WHERE superseded_by IS NULL`** unless you
>   specifically want to see Super Whisper's reprocessing history.
> - **Modes (`mode_name`) are user-configurable in Super Whisper** — don't
>   hard-code mode names without first checking which ones this user has
>   (recipe 0 below). Filter with `mode_name_lower` (case-insensitive,
>   indexed) once you know the names.
> - **Two canonical transcript columns** (as of v1.1.0):
>   - `raw_transcript` — what Scribe (STT) produced. Always present
>     for a successful recording.
>   - `processed_transcript` — what the LLM produced as post-processing.
>     `NULL` for voice-only modes where no LLM ran.
>
>   Use `processed_transcript` when you want the polished text, and
>   fall back to raw with `COALESCE(processed_transcript, raw_transcript)`
>   when you want "the best available transcript for this row".
>   Word counts: `raw_word_count` (from SW) and `processed_word_count`
>   (derived; non-zero exactly when `processed_transcript IS NOT NULL`).
>   The raw `result` / `llm_result` / `raw_result` columns are still
>   present for debugging access to SW's own fields, but they shouldn't
>   appear in day-to-day queries — they're noisy across SW versions.
>
> - **Sort and filter by `datetime_iso`**, not the raw `datetime`. SW
>   has shipped two `datetime` formats over time (`"2026-05-27 18:39:33.470"`
>   and `"2026-05-27T18:39:33.470Z"`) and lex-ordering them mixes up.
>   `datetime_iso` is the indexed, ISO-normalized form.
> - **Long recordings are chunked**. Rows with a word count above the
>   configured threshold (default 500) are also split into ~300-word
>   chunks in `recording_chunk` + `recording_chunk_vec` + `recording_chunk_fts`.
>   For "find the moment where I said X", use the chunk tables (recipes
>   13–17). For coarse filtering ("which meetings touch topic Y"), the
>   row-level `recording_vec` is the L2-normalized centroid of its
>   chunks. Short rows have a single vector and no chunks — query
>   `recording*` as usual.

```sql
-- 0. Discover the user's modes (run this first if you don't already
--    know what to filter on).
SELECT mode_name, COUNT(*) AS n
FROM recording
WHERE superseded_by IS NULL
GROUP BY mode_name
ORDER BY n DESC;

-- 1. Today's recordings, newest first. `COALESCE(processed, raw)`
--    gives "best available transcript": the LLM-polished text when
--    a mode ran an LLM, the Scribe text otherwise.
SELECT folder_name, datetime_iso, mode_name,

-- 3. Keyword search with snippet (FTS5). `recording_fts` indexes
--    `raw_transcript` (col 1) and `processed_transcript` (col 2),
--    so MATCH finds hits in either; `snippet(recording_fts, -1, …)`

--    Run from a shell, piping the SQL in (the $(echo '…' | swrag embed) expands

## Semantic search via `swrag embed`

`swrag embed` reads text from stdin and calls Ollama once, printing a SQLite
blob literal (`x'…'`) on stdout. The shell substitutes it into your SQL
before the SQL is ever parsed. From `swrag sql`'s perspective the SQL is just
a string with a blob literal in it.

```bash
# Single-shot semantic search: pipe the SQL in; the $(echo '…' | swrag embed)
# runs in a subshell with its own stdin and splices the blob into the heredoc.
swrag sql <<SQL
SELECT folder_name, vec_distance_cosine(embedding, $(echo 'hello' | swrag embed)) AS d
FROM recording_vec ORDER BY d LIMIT 5;
SQL

# Reuse the same vector twice (FTS + vec hybrid):
QV=$(echo 'how do notifications work' | swrag embed)
swrag sql <<SQL
<...query using $QV in two places...>
SQL
```

There is no in-SQL `embed()` function. The composition happens entirely
at the shell layer.

### Quoting-safe semantic search (use this for arbitrary user text)

The inline `$(echo '…' | swrag embed)` form is fine for simple text, but the
embed text is shell-evaluated inside the `echo` argument, so apostrophes
(`don't`, `it's`), `$`, and backticks need quoting. For arbitrary user
speech, read the text from **stdin** with a quoted heredoc — `<<'EOF'`
disables all shell expansion, so the text lands verbatim — then interpolate
the resulting blob variable into the SQL. The blob is hex plus `x''`, so it
carries no shell metacharacters and is safe to interpolate:

```bash
QV=$(swrag embed <<'EOF'
how do notifications work when I say "don't" and $HOME stuff
EOF
)
swrag sql <<SQL
SELECT r.folder_name, r.datetime_iso,
       vec_distance_cosine(v.embedding, $QV) AS dist
FROM recording_vec v JOIN recording r USING (folder_name)
WHERE r.superseded_by IS NULL
ORDER BY dist LIMIT 10;
SQL
```

`swrag embed` reads text from stdin only: a pipe (`echo 'hi' | swrag embed`)
or a quoted heredoc (`swrag embed <<'EOF' … EOF`). The heredoc is the one to
reach for whenever the text isn't under your direct control.

## Piping SQL via stdin

`swrag sql` reads SQL from stdin — a pipe (`echo "…" | swrag sql`), a quoted
heredoc (`swrag sql <<'SQL' … SQL`), or a file redirect (`swrag sql < f.sql`).
To forward sqlite3 flags, put them after `--` (`echo "…" | swrag sql -- -json`).
Given nothing on a TTY it errors. **Stdin is the quoting-safe path** for any
SQL containing single quotes, `$`, or backticks — a quoted heredoc (`<<'SQL'`)
disables all shell expansion, so the SQL is literal and you only need
SQL-standard `''` doubling for string literals:

```bash
# Pipe SQL (no shell escaping to worry about):
swrag sql <<'SQL'
SELECT folder_name, datetime_iso
FROM recording
WHERE raw_transcript LIKE '%don''t%'
  AND superseded_by IS NULL
ORDER BY datetime_iso DESC LIMIT 10;
SQL

# Same thing via echo / a file:
echo "SELECT folder_name FROM recording LIMIT 5" | swrag sql
swrag sql < query.sql
```

Combine piped SQL with sqlite3 flags by putting the flags after `--`
(SQL from stdin, flags forwarded to sqlite3):

```bash
swrag sql -- -json <<'SQL'
SELECT folder_name, datetime_iso FROM recording LIMIT 5;
SQL
```

(`echo "…" | swrag sql -- -json` works the same way — the SQL comes from
stdin, the `--` tail carries the flags.)

## Other output modes (and any other sqlite3 flag)

`swrag sql` defaults to sqlite3's `list` mode. For anything else
(`-json`, `-csv`, `-line`, `-column`, `-box`, `-markdown`, `-html`,
`-header`, `-separator`, `-cmd "…"`, etc.), put `--` after `sql` —
everything past the `--` is forwarded to sqlite3 verbatim:

```bash
echo "SELECT folder_name FROM recording LIMIT 5" | swrag sql -- -json
echo "<sql>" | swrag sql -- -csv
echo "<sql>" | swrag sql -- -cmd ".mode markdown"
echo "<sql>" | swrag sql -- -box

# Named-parameter binding via sqlite3's .parameter set
echo "SELECT folder_name FROM recording WHERE app_name = :app LIMIT 5" | \
  swrag sql -- -cmd ".parameter set :app 'Cursor'"
```

If you'd rather bypass `swrag sql` entirely (e.g. when scripting),
`swrag path` exposes the file paths so you can call `sqlite3` yourself:

```bash
sqlite3 "$(swrag path)" \
  -cmd ".load $(swrag path vec0) sqlite3_vec_init" \
  -cmd ".mode json" \
  "<sql>"
```

## Tips

- **FTS5 syntax.** Wrap phrases in double quotes: `MATCH '"corporate group"'`.
  Use `*` for prefix matching: `notif*`. Combine with `NEAR/3 word`.
- **Substring/fuzzy (trigram).** `recording_trgm` / `recording_chunk_trgm` match
  3-character windows, so `MATCH 'icing'` finds "pricing" and light typos
  ("notifcations") recall via shared trigrams. No stemming (use `recording_fts`
  for that); needs ≥3 chars. Also accelerates `LIKE '%str%'` / `GLOB '*str*'`
  to use the index instead of a full scan.
- **`LIMIT` is your job.** Output is not auto-limited — this is a local
  DB. Add an explicit `LIMIT` so the agent context doesn't drown in rows.
- **Read-only by default.** `swrag sql` opens via `file:…?mode=ro`. Any
  write SQL fails with sqlite3's "attempt to write a readonly database".
- **Append-only schema.** The archive raises on `DELETE FROM recording`
  (a `BEFORE DELETE` trigger). Use `source_deleted_at` to model "Super
  Whisper deleted this row" rather than actually deleting it.
- **Quoting.** With a quoted heredoc (`<<'SQL'`) the shell does no expansion,
  so you only need SQL-standard `''` doubling for string literals — no shell
  escaping to worry about:
  `swrag sql <<'SQL' … WHERE col = 'don''t' … SQL` (double the inner single
  quote).
