/**
 * Schema migrations applied in version order on every archive open.
 *
 * Add a new migration by:
 *
 *   1. Dropping a file `src/archive/migrations/NNN_short_name.sql` where
 *      `NNN` is the next integer (`003`, `004`, …).
 *   2. Importing it here with `with { type: "text" }`.
 *   3. Appending a row to `MIGRATIONS` with the new version + name + sql.
 *
 * NEVER edit an existing migration — published archives are running it.
 * NEVER reuse a version number for a different file. The runner skips
 * any migration whose version <= the archive's current `PRAGMA
 * user_version`, so a redefined "version 5" would silently never run
 * on an archive that already has user_version >= 5. (We learned this
 * the hard way: v0.7.0 shipped `005_meeting_queue.sql` and v1.0.0
 * replaced it with `005_cleanup_v09.sql`. v1.1.0's migration 006
 * re-runs the missed cleanup. `tests/migrations.test.ts` freezes
 * the sha256 of every shipped migration to catch a repeat at CI
 * time.) Need a fix? Add a new migration that corrects the state.
 *
 * The runner (`runMigrations` in `./migrate.ts`) reads SQLite's
 * `PRAGMA user_version`, applies anything strictly greater than it, and
 * bumps `user_version` inside the same transaction.
 *
 * Bun's `with { type: "text" }` import inlines the file content at build
 * time, so these strings travel inside the compiled binary — no runtime
 * filesystem reads.
